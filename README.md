# What I Learned
* Parse CSV Files
* Learn Python
* Use Python and SQLite concurrently to build a database
* Practice SQLite commands

# Syntax
python update.py â€”[add][del] --table [table_name] --record [record]
When deleting a row is it dependent on the key(s) of the table; for instance,
the table album_instrument has two keys, (album_id, instrument_id)
since there are multiple instances of an id in a row, both columns
are used as a key.

# Challenges
I had some trouble trying to run it at first because I was running the files
on my mac terminal but switched to the vs code terminal and it started working,
it might have been something on my end. Another challenge I had was
learning python as I built the database. Most of the class was theoretical so
I had to learn the language on my own time. More than half the time was spent on
reading the documentation of the language than actually coding.
