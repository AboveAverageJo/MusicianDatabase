# What I Learned
* Parse CSV Files
* Learn Python
* Use Python and SQLite concurrently to build a database
* Practice SQLite commands

# Syntax
python update.py â€”[add][del] --table [table_name] --record [record]  
python update.py --add --table album --record Hello World,1994,CD,001   
When deleting a row is it dependent on the key(s) of the table; for instance,
the table album_instrument has two keys, (album_id, instrument_id)
since there are multiple instances of an id in a row, both columns
are used as a key.

# Challenges
I had some trouble running the code at first but switched to the vs code terminal
and it started working, it might have been something on my end since I was using 
the terminal on the mac.  
Another challenge I had was learning python as I built the database. Most of the 
class was theoretical so I had to learn the language on my spare time. More than 
half the time was spent reading documentation of the language rather than actually 
coding.
