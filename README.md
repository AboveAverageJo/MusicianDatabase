# What I Learned
* Parse CSV Files
* Learn Python
* Use Python and SQLite concurrently to build a database
* Practice SQLite commands

# Syntax
python update.py â€”[add][del] --table [table_name] --record [record]
When deleting a row is it dependent on the key(s) of the table; for instance,
the table album_instrument has two keys, (album_id, instrument_id)
since there are multiple instances of an id in a row, both columns
are used as a key.

# Challenges
I had some trouble trying to run it at first because I was running the files
on my mac terminal but switched to the vs code terminal and it started working.
might be something on my end. Had fun doing this project even though it took me
a couple of days since I've never used python.
